	<p>The process of managing email begins with you&nbsp;&ndash; at your own desktop&nbsp;&ndash; when you make decisions about which emails and instant messages to delete, which ones to keep, and where to file them.</p>

The new email platform @canada.ca is one recent example. When this Email Transformation Initiative started, cleaning up emails became a major priority in many organizations.</p>
