<h1>Where to Save Electronic Information of Business Value</h1>
<div class="col-md-8" role="content">
	<p>Like any other information resource, email and instant messages that have business value should be transferred to and saved in your organization's official corporate repository.</p>
	<p class="list-continue">Here are a few reasons why email platforms in the governmental organizations are not used as corporate repositories:</p>
	<ul class="bullets-square">
		<li>You cannot share your saved emails with your colleagues: your email account is for you alone</li>
		<li>There is no automatic disposition feature in any email platform</li>
		<li>Email systems and instant messaging should only serve as communications tools</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="box-important">
		<p>Remember that neither Outlook nor any other email platforms used in your organization are corporate repositories.</p>
