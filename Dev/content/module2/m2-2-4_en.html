<h1>Examples of Information of Business Value</h1>
<div class="col-md-8" role="content">
	<p class="list-continue">Information resources that have business value are generally those that reflect the position or business of your organization. This means they:</p>
	<ul class="bullets-square">
		<li>Provide evidence of your organization's policy, planning, or mandated activities;</li>
		<li>Fulfill regulatory and legislative requirements;</li>
		<li>Provide the context for understanding your organization's roles and responsibilities;</li>
		<li>Document interactions between the public and the government;</li>
		<li>Provide evidence of approval or evolution of a document;</li>
		<li>Contain policies, directives, or briefing notes;</li>
		<li>Are final reports and recommendations;</li>
		<li>Contain work schedules and assignments; and</li>
		<li>Document meeting proceedings and records of decisions you have received from outside sources, which form part of your organization's records.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that we say "generally", because it always depends on the context within which the information resource was created. What has business value for your organization may not have business value for another one.</p>
