<div class="col-md-8" role="content">
	<p class="list-continue">There are different systems that can serve as repositories. Depending on your organization, a corporate repository might be:</p>
	<ul class="bullets-square">
		<!--<li>GCDOCS, RDIMS, or any other <a href="#e_ele" class="csps-glossary">electronic document</a> and records management system;</li>-->
		<li>GCDOCS, or any other <a href="#e_ele" class="csps-glossary">electronic document</a> and records management system;</li>
		<li>Designated shared drives; or</li>
		<li>Physical space, such as a records centre.</li>
		<!--<li>Database such as My GC HR, SAP; or</li>
		<li>Any combination of the above-mentioned systems.</li>-->
	</ul>
	<p>Check with your manager or <abbr title="information management">IM</abbr> specialist about where you should save your information. Your organization has guidelines in place that will help you identify where and how your information resources should be saved and what additional information is needed when saving them.</p>
