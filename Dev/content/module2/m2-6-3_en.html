When you capture metadata, you are building the context for an information resource to be searched and reused. Your information resource metadata could provide details on:</p>
	<ul class="bullets-square">
		<li>the type of document (an agenda, a draft, an invoice, etc.)</li>
		<li>the informationâ€™s author</li>
		<li>the application used to produce it (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.)</li>
