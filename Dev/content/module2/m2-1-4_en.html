<h1>Format of Information Resources</h1>
<div class="col-md-8" role="content">
	<p>When we refer to the "format" of information resources, we mean electronic information resources. Most information resources are created and communicated electronically. We still have information resources in the form of paper documents (physical objects), but not as many as we used to. Electronic systems are the primary means of creating, using, and managing information within the Government of Canada.</p>
	<p class="list-continue">The format of electronic information resources is defined by a file extension or a program used to create an information resource. For example:</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-8">
			<ul class="bullets-square">
				<li>Word</li>
				<li>Excel</li>
				<li>PowerPoint</li>
				<li>PDF</li>
				<li>AutoCAD</li>
				<li>MP3</li>
				<li>MPEG</li>
				<li>JPEG</li>
			</ul>
