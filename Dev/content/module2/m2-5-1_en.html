<h1>What to Keep and What to Delete</h1>
<div class="col-md-8" role="content">
	<p>Properly managing your information does not mean saving all of your information.</p>
	<p>It is part of your <abbr title="information management">IM</abbr> responsibilities to save and organize information resources of business value. You are only required to keep information resources that have business value for your organization.</p>
	<p>Identifying your <abbr title="information resources of business value">IRBVs</abbr> can sometimes be difficult. Do not hesitate to consult your manager or <abbr title="information management">IM</abbr> specialist about what information resources are considered to have business value.</p>
	<p>It is also part of your <abbr title="information management">IM</abbr> responsibilities to dispose of or delete any transitory information.</p>
	<p class="list-continue">You may destroy transitory information that:</p>
	<ul class="bullets-square">
		<!--<li>Have already been used to prepare information resources of business value and are no longer required; and</li>
		<li>Are not impacted by an active <a href="#a_acc" class="csps-glossary">access to information</a> (ATI), privacy, or litigation request.</li>-->
		<li>Has already been used to prepare information resources of business value and is no longer required; and</li>
		<li>Is not impacted by an active <a href="#a_acc" class="csps-glossary">access to information</a> (ATI), privacy, or litigation request.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>People tend to keep a lot of information for different reasons: might use it later, the director might need it one day, just in case, etc. Most of the time, they end up never using it.</p>
	<div class="box-important">
		<p>You should delete transitory information on a regular basis. Remember to delete all your transitory information from all locations where you have it saved, including copies stored on personal drives, shared drives, email systems, portable storage devices, hand-held devices, and laptops.</p>
