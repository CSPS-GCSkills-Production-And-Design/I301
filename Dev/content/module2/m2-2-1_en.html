<h1>What Is Information of Business Value?</h1>
<div class="col-md-8" role="content">
	<p class="list-continue">Not all information resources are created equal. They come in 2 main categories:</p>
	<ul class="bullets-square">
		<li>information of business value (IRBV)</li>
		<li>transitory information</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The length of time you need to keep the information resources&nbsp; and the purpose they serve&nbsp; differ.</p>
	<div class="box-definition">
		<p>Information resources that enable and document decision making in support of programs, services, and ongoing operations, and support departmental reporting, performance, and accountability requirements have business value.</p>
	</div>
	<p>Information and data that have business value are defined by individual organizations based on their mandates, and their regulatory and legislative functions and activities. Such information reveals what decisions were made and how. It is what makes the government accountable and transparent to the public.</p>
	<p>The Government of Canada is legally required to keep information of business value for a defined amount of time. Once the legal retention period has passed, it can be disposed of according to established guidelines. You may not arbitrarily make the decision to dispose of information of business value. You may want to consult your organization's <abbr title="information management">IM</abbr> professionals for more information.</p>

		<p>Depending on your organization, information that has business value represents approximately&nbsp;15% to&nbsp;20% of your total information resources.</p>
