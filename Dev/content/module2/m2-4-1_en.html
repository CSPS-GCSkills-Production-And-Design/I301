<h1>What Is Information of Archival Value?</h1>
<div class="col-md-8" role="content">
	<p>There is a special subgroup of information resources within information that has business value: information of <strong>archival</strong> value. These resources are also known as resources of historical value.</p>

	<p>Information of archival value is an information resource that has long-term importance and relevance to Canadian society. Examples include research documents that contain new or revolutionary ideas expected to be useful in the future, or legal documents that detail a court decision that may dramatically change how other courts view this issue.</p>
	
	<p>The volume of information of archival value identified by your organization depends on its mandate and not the size. For example, the Privy Council Office, because of its mandate, will produce a larger percentage of these resources than other, larger organizations.<p>
