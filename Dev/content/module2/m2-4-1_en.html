<h1>What Is Information of Enduring Value?</h1>
<div class="col-md-8" role="content">
	<p>There is a special subgroup of information resources within information that has business value. It's called information resources of <strong>enduring</strong> value (IREV). These resources are also known as resources of historical or archival value.</p>
	<p><abbr title="information resources of enduring value">IREVs</abbr> are information resources that have long-term importance and relevance to Canadian society. Examples include research documents that contain new or revolutionary ideas expected to be useful in the future, or legal documents that detail a court decision that may dramatically change how other courts view this issue.</p>
	<p>The volume of <abbr title="information resources of enduring value">IREVs</abbr> identified by your organization depends on its mandate and not the size. For example, the Privy Council Office, because of its mandate, will produce a larger percentage of these resources than other larger organizations.<p>
