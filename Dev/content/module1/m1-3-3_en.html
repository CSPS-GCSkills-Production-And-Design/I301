<h1>Directive on Open Government</h1>
<div class="col-md-8" role="content">
	<p>The Directive on Open Government is a foundational open government commitment of the Government of Canada. The objective of the directive is to maximize the release of government information resources of business value as part of the federal government's commitment to enhance transparency and accountability.</p>
	<p>As stipulated in the Directive, each GC organization publishes an Open Government Implementation Plan (OGIP) that describes the planned activities to meet the requirements of the directive, including the development of data and information inventories. </p>The long term goal of this directive is to create a culture of "open by default" in the GC. Our colleagues from other federal organizations shouldn't have to complete an <a href="#a_acc" class="csps-glossary">Access to Information</a> request to get access to the information we created last week. So, when you follow <abbr title="Information Management">IM</abbr> guidelines and best practices in your daily activities at work, you facilitate information sharing for all kinds of purposes.</p>
