<h1>Open Government</h1>
<div class="col-md-8" role="content">
	<p>In the Government of Canada, open government is about fostering greater openness and accountability, enhancing citizen participation in policymaking and service design, and creating a more efficient and responsive government.</p>
<p>The international open government movement is led by the Open Government Partnership (<abbr>OGP</abbr>), a multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.</p>

<abbr title="Open Government Partnership">OGP</abbr> was formally launched in 2011 by 8 founding governments. Since that time, it has welcomed the commitment of 78 countries and a growing number of local governments to join the Partnership. Canada joined the <abbr title="Open Government Partnership">OGP</abbr> in 2012 and has since developed an open government plan every two years.</p></div></div>

    <div class="box-information">
<p>The <abbr title="Open Government Partnership">OGP</abbr> develops yearly implementation plans outlining a set of collective deliverables for its members. To meet these deliverables, the GC develops biennial National Action Plans on Open Government. A great deal of progress has been made in the years since its implementation in 2012, making the Government of Canada a leader in open government.
