<h1>Open Government</h1>
<div class="col-md-8" role="content">
	<p>In the Government of Canada, open government is about fostering greater openness and accountability, enhancing citizen participation in policymaking and service design, and creating a more efficient and responsive government.</p>
<p>The international open government movement is led by the Open Government Partnership (OGP), a multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.</p>

The OGP was formally launched in 2011 by eight founding governments. Since that time, it has welcomed the commitment of 75 governments to join the Partnership. Canada joined the OGP in 2012 and has since developed an open government plan every two years.</p></div></div>
