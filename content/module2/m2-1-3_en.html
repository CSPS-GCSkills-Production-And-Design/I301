<h1>Types of Information Resources</h1>
<div class="col-md-8" role="content">
	<p>The types of information resources depend on their function. As an employee of the Government of Canada, you may write reports, set up meetings, communicate decisions, etc.</p>
	<p class="list-continue">Here are examples of types of information resources:</p>
	<ul class="bullets-square">
		<li>memos</li>
		<li>reports</li>
		<li>meeting notes</li>
		<li>invoices</li>
		<li>contracts</li>
		<li>database</li>
		<li>wiki</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This list is not exhaustive, either. Remember that in the definition, information resources are "produced in published and unpublished form regardless of&nbsp;â€¦ production mode, or recording medium."</p>
