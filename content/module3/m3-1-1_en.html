<h1>Modern-Day Communication</h1>
<div class="col-md-8" role="content">
	<p>Nowadays, electronic messaging such as emails and instant messages are the predominant mode of communication for most people.</p>
	<p>Email is one of the most common forms of internal and external communication in the Government of Canada. (By "email", we mean both individual email and generic email accounts.)</p>

		<div><h4>Did you know?</h4>
		<p class="list-continue didyouknow">Library and Archives Canada issued Email Management Guidelines for the public service in&nbsp;2008. At that time, it was estimated that on average:</p>
		<ul class="bullets-square">
			<li>Government employees each received and created at least 50&nbsp;emails every day; and</li>
			<li>Government organizations received or sent 50&nbsp;million email messages every year.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Not including instant messaging, we can definitely state that these numbers have increased significantly over the past few years.</p></div>
