<h1>Protecting and Safeguarding Information</h1>
<div class="col-md-8" role="content">
    <p>Although most government information is open to the public, there are exceptions to this open-by-default principle, such as personal information, <a href="#c_cab" class="csps-glossary">Cabinet confidences</a>, etc.</p>
    <p>Government information may also require some level of protection.</p>
    <p>In particular, you need to properly mark and adequately safeguard <a href="#p_pro" class="csps-glossary">protected</a> and <a href="#c_cla" class="csps-glossary">classified</a> in all media, as its compromise could cause injury to individuals or damage to the national interest.</p>
    <p>Speak to your organization's security officers or <abbr title="information management">IM</abbr> professionals to learn more about your specific procedures and responsibilities regarding the handling of protected and classified information.</p>
